      //     "A credit union is a member-owned financial cooperative that provides a range of financial services to its members. Unlike traditional banks, which are typically for-profit institutions owned by shareholders, credit unions aim to be financially sustainable while operating as not-for-profit organizations. Profits generated by credit unions are reinvested into the organization to benefit its members, such as through lower loan rates, higher savings rates, or expanded services. Members of credit unions are both owners and customers, giving them a direct say in the management and operations of the institution.",

      //     "The credit union movement in Sierra Leone traces its roots to the cooperative movement that began in the early to mid-20th century. Credit unions, also known as savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs), emerged as part of this tradition. The regulation and supervision of credit unions fall under the Ministry of Trade and Industry through the Department of Cooperatives. The Cooperative Societies Act of 1977 provides the legal framework for the establishment and operation of credit unions in the country.",

This initiative has empowered thousands of women, making them more financially literate, self-reliant, and vocal in their communities. These credit unions have significantly increased income-earning opportunities, access to affordable loans, and addressed social challenges such as gender inequality and decision-making in households and communities.
      // As of May 2024, the 10 credit unions supported by SEND have over 7,070 individual members and 1,366 VSLA groups, representing more than 40,000 members. These credit unions, located in Kailahun, Kenema, Kono, Bonthe, and Falaba districts, have total assets valued at SLE 59,750,000 (approximately 2.5 million USD).
